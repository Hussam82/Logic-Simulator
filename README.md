#### Logic-Simulator
## A simple logic simulator that provides a mechanism to run and simulate logic circuits then find the desired outputs for different designs.

## Input Format

The input follows these formats:

gate type (such as AND/OR gate)
The inputs and output symbols
Write "SET" values to the inputs (either 0 or 1)
Write "SIM" to start simulation
Write "OUT" to view the output of a specific node or "OUT ALL" to view all nodes' values
